# This strategy is a form of "best-first search." Instead of processing clauses in the order they are generated (like BFS), it prioritizes processing shorter clauses first. The heuristic is that shorter clauses are simpler and more likely to lead to the ultimate shortest clause: the empty clause [] (length 0).
# How It Works ðŸ§ 
# The core of this strategy is a priority queue instead of a standard FIFO queue.

# Prioritization: Each clause is assigned a priority based on its length (the number of literals it contains). Shorter clauses get higher priority.

# Selection: At each step of the proof, we select the clause with the highest priority (the shortest one) from the queue to resolve next.

# Insertion: When new clauses (resolvents) are generated, they are added to the priority queue according to their length.

# This approach guides the search toward simpler clauses, often finding a proof more quickly than an uninformed strategy like Breadth-First Search, which would explore all clauses of a certain depth equally.
