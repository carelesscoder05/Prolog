% Base Case: The SoS queue is empty, so no more work can be done. Proof fails.

% Recursive Step: Process the first clause from the SoS queue.

# The core idea is to prevent the prover from doing useless work by resolving axioms against each other. Instead, every resolution must involve the goal you're trying to prove (or a clause derived from it).
# How It Works ðŸ§ 
# The Set of Support (SoS) strategy works by partitioning your initial clauses into two groups:

# The Knowledge Base (KB): These are your trusted axioms and facts. We assume this set of clauses is internally consistent (satisfiable).

# The Set of Support (SoS): This set initially contains only the clauses that come from the negated goal.

# The resolution process is then restricted by one simple rule: you cannot resolve two clauses that are both from the KB. At least one of the parent clauses in any resolution step must originate from the Set of Support.

# Any new clause (a resolvent) that is generated is added to the SoS. This way, the prover stays "focused" on the goal, as every new piece of information is directly related to the initial query. It's like a detective only following leads that are connected to the specific crime, rather than interviewing random people in the city.
