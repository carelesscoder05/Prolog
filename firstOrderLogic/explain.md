Of course. Let's break down the final resolution prover code into its main components and explain how they work together.

The program is a **theorem prover for First-Order Logic (FOL)**. Its goal is to determine if a query is true based on a knowledge base. It does this using the **resolution by refutation** method.

The code is built in three main parts:
1.  **FOL-to-CNF Converter:** A pre-processor that prepares the logic.
2.  **Resolution Engine:** The core inference mechanism that searches for a proof.
3.  **Knowledge Base & Runner:** Where you define your problem.

### ## Part 1: The FOL-to-CNF Converter

Resolution only works on a simple, standard format called **Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF)**. This part of the code is a pipeline that converts any complex FOL statement into CNF. The main predicate is `to_cnf/2`.



Think of it like an assembly line for logical formulas:
1.  **Eliminate `iff` and `imp`:** It first removes complex connectives like bi-implications (`<=>`) and implications (`=>`), replacing them with basic `and`, `or`, and `not`.
2.  **Move `not` Inwards:** It uses De Morgan's laws to push all `not` operators inward until they are directly attached to a predicate (e.g., `not(and(A,B))` becomes `or(not(A), not(B))`).
3.  **Skolemize:** This is a clever trick to remove `exists` (`∃`, "for some") quantifiers. It replaces existentially quantified variables with special placeholders. If a variable exists on its own, it's replaced by a unique constant (e.g., `skc0`). If it depends on other universally quantified variables, it's replaced by a function of those variables (e.g., `skf0(X)`).
4.  **Drop `forall`:** After Skolemization, any remaining variables are assumed to be universally quantified (`∀`, "for all"), so the `forall` symbols are simply dropped for cleanliness.
5.  **Distribute and Collect:** Finally, it uses the distributive law to ensure the formula is a big `and` of smaller `or` clauses, like `(A ∨ B) ∧ (C ∨ D)`. It then collects these into the list-of-lists format the engine needs, like `[[A, B], [C, D]]`.

### ## Part 2: The Resolution Engine

This is the heart of the program that performs the proof search.

#### **`prove/3` - The Mission Control**
This is the top-level predicate that manages the proof.
* It takes the user's knowledge base and query.
* It calls the `to_cnf/2` converter on every formula.
* Most importantly, it **negates the query**. To prove `kills(curiosity, tuna)`, it adds `neg(kills(curiosity, tuna))` to the knowledge base. This is the "refutation" part of the strategy.
* It then hands control to the main loop.

#### **`resolution_loop/4` - The Main Loop**
This predicate tirelessly searches for a contradiction.
* **Strategy:** It uses a **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**, meaning it explores all shorter proof paths before trying longer ones. This guarantees finding the most direct proof.
* **Set of Support:** It operates on a queue of clauses called the `SoS` (Set of Support). This queue initially contains only the clauses from the negated query, making the search more focused.
* **Termination:** The loop stops when one of three things happens:
    1.  **Success:** It derives an empty clause `[]`, which represents a direct contradiction. This means the negated query was false, so the original query must be true.
    2.  **Failure:** The `SoS` queue becomes empty, meaning there are no more lines of reasoning to follow. The proof fails.
    3.  **Timeout:** The `MaxDepth` iteration limit is reached.

#### **`resolve/3` - The Core Inference Rule**
This is the single most important rule in the engine. It takes two clauses and produces a new one.
1.  It finds two **complementary literals** in the two parent clauses (e.g., `animal(X)` in one and `neg(animal(tuna))` in the other).
2.  It **unifies** them, finding a variable binding that makes them match (in this case, `{X = tuna}`).
3.  It creates a new clause (the "resolvent") by combining the remaining parts of the parent clauses and applying the substitution to all variables.

### ## Part 3: The Knowledge Base & Runner

This is where you, the user, define the problem.

* **`kb_fol/1`:** Each logical statement in your knowledge base is defined as a separate `kb_fol/1` fact. This is crucial for ensuring that variables like `X` in one rule are treated as distinct from `X` in another rule.
* **`run/0`:** This is a simple helper predicate that uses `findall/3` to collect all the separate `kb_fol/1` facts into a single list and then passes them to the `prove` predicate to start the inference process.
